  - >  The new camera, known as an optical phased-array receiver, or OPA, collects the light from which it forms its image using a grid of devices called grating couplers. The prototype (the blue structure pictured above, attached to a thick mounting block to make it easier to handle) has 64 of them. Grating couplers are optical antennae. They collect light and send it to a device called a waveguide. This carries light around in a way analogous to a wire carrying electricity.
