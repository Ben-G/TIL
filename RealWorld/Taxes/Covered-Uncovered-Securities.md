#Covered & Non-Covered Securities

If you are selling securities that have been held for multiple years then brokers will report the proceeds of your sales to the IRS in two different ways:

- Covered Securities: **All Securities acquired on or after January 1, 2011**, the broker will report both the proceeds and the acquisition cost
- Non-Covered Securities: **Acquired prior to 2011**, the broker might only report the proceeds and you will need to report the cost basis yourself

Obviously this is a brief personal note and **not tax advice** the underlying regulation is a lot more complex: https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Cost-Basis-Reporting-FAQs
