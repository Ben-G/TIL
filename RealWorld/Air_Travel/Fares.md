How Airfaires work: https://bookingbusinesstravel.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/howairfareswork/

> **IT Fares**

> Inclusive Tour (IT) fares are even more secretive than the above fare types. Tour operators are supplied with very low fares which are only to be sold to the public if they are bundled with hotels, car hire etc., so that the actual air-fare content is not revealed. Some agents have been known to sell these tickets outside of a package deal and airlines are continually monitoring and attempting to stamp out this practise.
