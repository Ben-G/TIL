- Two interesting articles on additive manufacturing by the Economist:

  - Additive manufacturing could significantly change the design constraints on manufacturing. Additive is a lot better at manufacturing designs with empty spaces

  - https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21724368-recent-advances-make-3d-printing-powerful-competitor-conventional-mass-production-3d

    - Seems like 3D printing is becoming ready for mass-production.

    - GE invested $1.5bn to manufacture jet nuzzles via additive manufacturing

    - > Each LEAP uses 19 nozzles, which have new features, such as complex cooling ducts, that GE says can be created in no other way. The nozzles are printed as single structures instead of being welded together from 20 or more components as previous versions were. The new nozzles are also 25% lighter than older designs, which saves fuel. And they are five times more durable, which reduces servicing costs.

    - AM (Additive Manufacturing) first big in health industry, since prosthetics and other medical devices often need to fit patients individually

    - Next interesting step: additive manufacturing + living tissue -> **Bioprinting**

      - > Cellinkâ€™s ink is made from nanocellulose alginate, a biodegradable material containing wood fibres and a sugary polymer found in seaweed. Researchers first mix their cells into the bio-ink and then extrude the result as a filament from which the desired shape is constructed. The company has gone on to develop tissue-specific bio-inks that contain growth factors needed to stimulate particular types of cells, including stem cells. These are cells that can proliferate to produce any of the cell types that form a particular tissue. If the stem cells in question are obtained from the patient into whom the transplant will later be inserted, that will reduce the risk that the transplant will be rejected.
