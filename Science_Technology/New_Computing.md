## ReRam

- ["A memory chip that can compute"](http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21717807-new-type-processor-small-devices-memory-chip-can-compute)
  -  Resistive random-access memory, or [ReRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistive_random-access_memory)
  - Uses ions instead of transistors
    - " The chips they are interested in are made of tiny “cells” instead of transistors. Each cell has two electrodes (a transistor has three), and these sandwich a layer of metal oxide. This oxide (commonly of tantalum or hafnium) changes its state of electrical resistance in response to pulses of charge passed through it by the electrodes. The change in resistance is caused by the movement within the oxide of some of the oxygen ions which make up its crystal lattice."
    - "Crucially, the relocated oxygen ions stay put when the power is switched off"
    - "So far, the three researchers have managed to construct a tantalum-based ReRAM with seven states of resistance. Eight are possible, and perhaps more, with more research. Eight levels is a good initial target, because it would permit the representation in a single cell of all possible three-digit binary numbers (ie, 000, 001, 010, 011, 101, 111, 110 and 100). A conventional chip would need three transistors to do this."
