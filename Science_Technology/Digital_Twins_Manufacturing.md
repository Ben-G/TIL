[Economist: The Gemini makers | Millions of things will soon have digital twins](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21725033-factories-cars-range-consumer-products-millions-things-will-soon-have-digital)

- Siemens runs an 75% automated factory that makes industrial computer control systems

- Entire production flow is simulated as well; tweaks are first made in the simulation, then applied to the actual factory.

- Factory has a "digital twin"

  - > One motivation for twinning is to bring products to market faster and at a lower cost. The digital twin allows endless design iterations to be tried in the virtual world without having to stop the production line to see how they can be made, says Mr Mrosik. 

- Products are also starting to have "digital twins", i.e. data about products is collected during their usage and can be used as input for simulations & production improvements.

- > The spread of digital twins could shake up supply chains. For example, suppliers could be asked to submit a digital twin of their product so that it can be tested in a manufacturer’s virtual factory before an order is placed. It is already a requirement at the Amberg plant for suppliers to deliver a digital twin along with their product to help installation.

- > Twins will become more responsive still as products are increasingly fitted with sensors that relay data to the internet. 

- > Even mass-produced goods that are far less complex are likely to end up having digital siblings. This would help with product tracking and verification, which is increasingly important in food manufacturing and pharmaceutical production. Just about any product could have a unique identifier that links to production data, if not a full digital twin, reckons Thomas Körmendi, the chief executive of Kezzler, a Norwegian company that produces secure product codes using an algorithm.
