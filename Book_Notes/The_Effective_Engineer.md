Notes on "The Effective Engineer".

# Foreword & Intro

- Extremely few engineers understand how much influence they can have on the impact of their work; not by working harder, but by understanding which activities are high-leverage and which ones not
- Will not get credit for working hard on features that no one will use
- **Effective Engineers produce results**; when evaluating engineers we (should?) focus on outcomes: build features users pay for; build tools that improve team productivity


## Chapter 1: Focus on High Leverage Activities

- Example of high leverage activity: mentoring new employees
	- At Quora: dedicated mentor assigned for first few months
	- In a single year, a typical engineer works between 1,880 and 2,820 hours; Mentoring one hour every day for first month (20 hrs) adds up to only 1% of time new hire will work through first year
	- Teaching time saving skills in this period can have outsized impact
- Leverage is measured simply: Impact / Time 
- **Questions to ask to improve leverage:**
	- How can I complete this activity in shorter time?
	- How can I increase valu produced by activity?
	- Is there something else I could spend my time on that is more valuable?
- Practical examples of increasing leverage: meetings (*I'm aware of these, but definitely worth stating*):
	- Default to 30 minutes instead of 60 minutes meeting
	- Prepare agenda and circulate beforehand
	- Replace meeting with async communication if in-person is not relevant
- Focusing on leverage does not mean focusing on easy wins:
	- Example, 	Yishan Wong needed to direct a lot of time towards  making hiring at FB a top priority
	
**Takeaway:**

- Use leverage to measure engineering effectiveness, systematically increase leverage over time
	
*Key idea here is that engineers (especially in smaller orgs) have more freedom than they are aware of to choose what to work on. Realizing this can increase impact a lot, by shifting focus to high leverage activies. Also, be concious about how you spend your time.*

## Chapter 2: Optimize for Learning

- Pick the right environment to learn in: large company for depth of skills; smaller for breadth
- Growth mindest is incredibly important for learning
- Tamar Bercovici of Box recommends new hires to "own their story"
	- Didn't have full-time dev job before joining Box
	- Ended up leading distributed data team within 2 yrs
	- *Even if background is not perfect fit for current job; you will have learnt relevant skills; selling "your story" & growth mindest become more important in that case* 
- Reid Hoffman recommendation from *Startup of You*:
	- Treat yourself like startup; early on prioritize learning over profability
- Seek fast growth environments for learning
- **Ask specific questions ** to identify the learning potential your project could have (ideally before joining company, *Note: all of these are focused on folks interested in startups*)
	- Weekly monthly growth rates? 
	- Are there high priority initiatives to work on? That have sufficient support in resources?
	- How agressively has company been hiring? 
- Evaluate onboarding process: is there formal mentorship? What new things have team members learned recently?
- How open is the communication?
	- Do employees now about priorities of different teams?
	- Do teams do product/outage post-mortems?
	- How is knowledge shared/documented?
	- Examples of lessons learned from past projects?
- Is moving quickly considered a company value? (moving quicker enables more learning)
- During interview: what could you learn from interviewers? were interviews rigorous and comprehensive? (would you want to work with people that pass the interview?)
- Do people have autonomy over what to work on? Can they switch teams?
- **Take personal 20% time to improve skills daily**
- Work on a diversity of projects within the company; otherwise hard to pick up entirely new skills
- Jump fearless into unknown code
	
*Really liked the specific questions for prodding potential new companies. All of them are relevant for building a great engineering culture as well. Otherwise the chapter offered traditional insight: read, network, try to rotate projects, etc.*

## Chapter 3: Prioritize Regularly

# Conclusion

Really great book overall; condenses a lot of practical lessons learned in recent years into a single book. Mostly offers practical advice. At times there's a missing causation link between a described action and the resulting outcome (mostly seems a lot of unmentioned factors were at play as well).
