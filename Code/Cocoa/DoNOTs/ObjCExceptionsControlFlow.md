Don't use Objective-C exceptions to manage control flow in programs. They are not intended to be caught but instead to model reasons why an application needs to be terminated. One symptom of this assumption is the incompatibility of exceptions with ARC: http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html#exceptions

> The standard Cocoa convention is that exceptions signal programmer error and are not intended to be recovered from. Making code exceptions-safe by default would impose severe runtime and code size penalties on code that typically does not actually care about exceptions safety. Therefore, ARC-generated code leaks by default on exceptions, which is just fine if the process is going to be immediately terminated anyway. Programs which do care about recovering from exceptions should enable the option.
