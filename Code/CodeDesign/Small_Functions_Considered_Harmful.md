Key Quotes:

> If we start thinking about the code we write as something that dies *every single time we add a new git commit*, I think we might be more incentivized to write code that’s amenable to easy modification. When thinking about how to abstract, it greatly helps to be cognizant of the fact that the code we’re building might probably only be a few hours away from dying (being modified). Thus optimizing for *ease of modification* of code tends to work better than trying to build topdown narratives of the sort proposed in *Clean Code*.
