	- Immutable, Append only DB instead of Shared Mutable State
	- Expose Transaction Log / Event Stream; Materialized Views are Updated with the content appended to the transaction log
	- "The difference to traditional database architecture is that if you want to write to the system, you donâ€™t write directly to the same databases that you read from. Instead, you write to the log, and there is an explicit transformation process which takes the data on the log and applies it to the materialized views."
