# SE

- [Thinking above the Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Yp3j_jk8Q), Microsoft Research, 2014
  - Discusses interesting aspects of importance of specs & proofs
- [Turning the Database Inside Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9hR3kiOK0), Strange Loop, 2014
  - Immutable, Append only DB instead of Shared Mutable State
  - Expose Transaction Log / Event Stream; Materialized Views are Updated with the content appended to the transaction log
  - "The difference to traditional database architecture is that if you want to write to the system, you donâ€™t write directly to the same databases that you read from. Instead, you write to the log, and there is an explicit transformation process which takes the data on the log and applies it to the materialized views."
- [Conceptualizing Large Software Systems](http://www.thedotpost.com/2015/11/alan-shreve-conceptualizing-large-software-systems), dotGo, 2015
  - Discusses techniques/tools to make large code bases more approachable / make it easier to understand code structure
  - Uses Go test coverage + compiler tools to strip down relevant code based on test cases



# ML

- https://www.crowdflower.com/train-ai-2017/ Peter Norvig's Talk (can't link directly)
  - SE: Mathemetical Science; ML: Natural Science
  - ML still early on:
    - So far only able to classify small slices of pictures accurately
    - Easy to fool ML systems (example panda image + noise applied)
  - Bugs in ML hard to find; no clear inputs & outputs
  - Feedback loops exist in which ML influences users enough such that past ML data is no longer valid
  - ML lacks tooling

#Tools

- [Catastrophic Backtracking in Regex](https://vimeo.com/112065252), Stack Overflow Interal Talk, 2014
  - Discusses how backtracking in regex caused downtime on Stack Overflow
  - Also discusses how to avoid catastrophic backtracking
