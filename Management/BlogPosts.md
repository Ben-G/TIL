  - >  few dependencies, single owners, minimal decision points

  - > Setting up your team the way you would set up a machine can give you a ton of leverage — as long as you realize how complicated and unpredictable the people in that machine can be

  - > Instead, if you simply outline the problem and what success looks like — let’s say it’s increasing revenue by 100% — all paths to success are still possible, including those you haven’t thought of yourself. It’s very likely that someone on your team will think of a better solution, but as soon as you say what you think, everyone gets a whole lot less creative.

  - > Asking questions designed to empower and not instruct requires a lot of forethought. **Consider putting 10 minutes on your calendar before any meeting to think through which questions will be helpful and won’t interfere with your team’s ability to win.**

  - > **If you’re rigorously accountable, your team becomes more accountable**. Whatever you say you're going to do, just do it

  - > But what if you’re building some sort of enterprise system for long-distance truckers and you don’t even drive? Look for even minor or tangential ways to empathize with your users. As an example, when I worked at **LiveOps**, we were building call center infrastructure. We looked to our own customer service department to get their feedback and pipe it back into our product development loop. Entangle yourself with your customers to understand what they're experiencing on a deeper level, why it needs to be better, and how you can improve it.

  - > A lot of managers forget how important their approval is. **The bulk of your team is there and working as hard as they can to please you**. That’s just the way it is, so you have to let people know when you’re pleased, when you’re excited, when you’re impressed.

  - > I take my teams out to dinner and encourage them to go out together without me. **I seat my teams together because proximity builds relationships.** 

  - > The more you trust the people you work with, the better the product you’re going to build. Quantum managers encourage people to get to know each other on a personal level. They start meetings with people sharing about their lives, not just their work. They seed conversations about topics that are much more expansive than the task at hand so people truly get to know each other.

  - > As soon as a chain of authority is introduced, ideas no longer stand on their own merit.
