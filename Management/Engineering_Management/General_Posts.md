HubSpot Eng Management: product over process

https://medium.com/hubspot-product/why-our-engineering-leaders-focus-on-product-over-process-26224aa4b36b

> Companies that heavily focus on process often do so because they have rigid expectations and looming deadlines. At companies like these, an engineering manager’s job is to create a predictable, reliable engineering team that delivers on what product owners tell them to do. They may spend a lot of their time running a software prediction process, like Scrum, in order to ensure that they’re meeting their commitments. But we have few solid deadlines at HubSpot, which means that we don’t need to subscribe to any specific methodology.

> We believe that a predictable, reliable engineering team that builds the wrong thing is not a success. The engineering leader (and the engineers themselves) have to feel ownership and responsibility around *what* they are building, not just *how* they are building it.
