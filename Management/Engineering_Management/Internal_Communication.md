- Story about insights from writing and sharing "Week in Review" articles internally

- Realized different reasons for disconnects between ICs and management

- Triaged different scenarios in which ICs don't understand why management is acting in a certain way ("why can't they just")

- > Stealing a page out of other leaders’ books, I began writing a “Week in Review” post every two weeks or so at Etsy, with a link open to anyone internally, and a distribution list of the people in my organization. I used it as a reflection on themes that were coming up in weekly one-on-ones, backchannels, team meetings, etc.

  > This Week in Review post touched on a refrain I began to hear more and more often as changes were happening internally at the company. It’s slightly edited to make sense to those unfamiliar with the issues I’m referencing.

  > tl;dr of this lengthy, philosophical WIR: When you’re wondering about why senior leadership isn’t behaving a way you wish they would, approach this by: 1) assuming best intentions, 2) fostering curiosity over cynicism, and 3) thinking about where you have influence.

- > For instance, a coworker recently shared with me his realizations about why reorg communications are incredibly hard; in the past, it was easy to say “why don’t they just”, but now, being responsible for it for the first time, he can see why it’s much more nuanced and challenging than the tip of the iceberg he saw before.

- > **You do have influence, if not authority**; your influence can take the form of curiosity, and of assuming best intentions as you go. The answer to “why can’t they just” might be a three-hour answer, because if there was a *short*answer, they’d probably have done it already. :)

  > And I’m here to support you through this - I may ask you challenging questions, and push you to do more research and listening, but in return I will give you my personal take as well as my “temporary seat at the table” take. I think there are *so* many opportunities to do this kind of work right now, and **it’s my job to help you find them**.
