## Introduction

- PMs need huge set of knowledge
  - Technical, reading drawings, machinery, visualize construction process, plan, procure materials, order subcontractors, safety, QA/QC, required documentation, dealing with stakeholders of all sorts, financials & cost reports, legal understanding
  - On large projects might have assistants:
    - Planners, Quality Control, Safety, Engineers, Contract Admins, clerc staff,
  - 24/7 job; dependent on environment
  - Deal with missing, incorrect information from designers
  - No two construction projects are the same
- Same mistakes are repeated across projects over and over:
  - Staff not following schedule
  - Bad reporting
  - **Almost always bad: resourcing, materials ordering**
- Most successful projects wher PM (GC), client and subcontractor worked together as one team
  - *Again, seems like the game changer in construction might not be technology, but vertical organization?*

## Chapter 1 - Plannning the Project

- Most important phase of a project

  - Many problems in project are result of poor decisions in planning

- Most successful project author participated in, was a follow-up project, similar to an earlier one, with the same client

  - Client skipped much of the procurement process and went with his firm early on
  - Got involved in the project early, since they were picked as contractor in the design phase -> better collaboration between design and GC

- In many projects the contractor's PM is not part of tender phase (preconstruction); missing out on a lot of collaboration opportunities

  - [*Tender Phase*](http://www.pathsforall.org.uk/pfa/glossary-of-path-construction-terminology/tender-phase.html)

  - > A pre-construction stage of a path construction project where a [contractors](http://www.pathsforall.org.uk/pfa/glossary-of-path-construction-terminology/contractor.html) services are obtained or purchased by a [client](http://www.pathsforall.org.uk/pfa/glossary-of-path-construction-terminology/client.html) to carry out the path construction work, and to plan, manage, monitor, coordinate and control health and safety on site during the [construction phase](http://www.pathsforall.org.uk/pfa/glossary-of-path-construction-terminology/construction-phase.html).

  - Leaves PM with very little time to come up with schedule, submit paperwork, find personell, etc.

- PM immediately needs all contract documents

- Tender contract documents describe inlcude the **scope of work**,  **bill of quantities** and **tender drawings**

  - > A **bill of quantities** (BOQ) is a document used in [tendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_for_bids) in the [construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction) industry / supplies in which [materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_material), parts, and labor (and their costs) are itemized. It also (ideally) details the terms and conditions of the construction or repair contract and itemizes all work to enable a [contractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_contractor) to price the work for which he or she is bidding.The quantities may be measured in number, length, area, volume, weight or time. Preparing a bill of quantities requires that the design is complete and a specification has been prepared.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_quantities)

  - Example Scope of Work: https://www.loudoun.gov/DocumentCenter/View/78798

  - Example Bill of Quantities: http://www.undp.ps/en/forms/callforproposals/2011/boqtankl2.pdf

- First work off of tender drawings (these are what the client paid for), oer time construction drawings will come in (changes need to be tracked)

  - Most important drawing is 'Overall Layout'

- Once full set of construction drawings -> file one as a master set

- Important Qs: job site, what is provided by client, site conditions?

- **Tender handover meeting:** defines basic outline of project execution, such as start end dates, staffing, suppliers and contractors, major risks, etc.

  - A lot of input in this meeting comes from estimators that have looked at the construction documents

- Term: "lay down area" -> where new materials are delivered/stored/assembled



**Planning the execution**

- Client can suggest how project be performed; but it's up to you to pick an appropriate executon plan
- **Project schedule** 
  - is developed by contractor and approved by client
  - Schedule governs order of construction, defines penalties, shows when info from client is required
  - PM might have access to a Planner to perform a lot of the planning (but they often lack construction insight, so PM still needs to be involved)
  - Worth spending  a lot of time on schedule to ensure project is actually constructable in proposed timeframe
  - Client usually insists that important dates from tender schedule remain the same in construction schedule; but now is last chance to change
  - Tender and construction drawings can be significantly different in detail; **if schedule is built of off tender its important to revise once construction drawings are available.**
  - Resourcing is critical part of schedule: how many workers of which profession at which time?
  - Part of schedule:
    - decide on self-perform vs. subcontractor
      - Different types of subcontracting:
        - labor-only: sub only supplies labor, GC is still responsible for supervision, material, equipment
        - full: subcontractor supplies everything
- Now is time to consider alternative construction methods and alternative designs that can save time & cost
- Consider which formwork to use, consider vertical access (elevators, etc.)
- Next staffing/manning:
  - Blue collar workers should be reviewed by Formen (leader of a trade group) or Supervisors
  - Staffing plan depends on things as: number of work areas, client requirements, skills & experience
  - Actuall staffing typically happens through central HR
  - Often you haven't worked with staff previously -> bad
    - *Another organizational, not technical angle to improve construction productivity*
- Compare org chart at tender stage with org chart at construction stage; ideally should line up
- Put staff onto timeline
- Site access requirements (trainings, certifications, clothing, approval process) -> important for staffing to ensure all staff meets requirements
- **Plant and equipment**: ensuring project has acess to the right large & small equipment 
- Plan onsite facilities, office, storage, lockers, conference room, worker facilites for eating, bathroom, access to utilites such as power, water, sevage 
- Think about transformers, cables, etc.; provision utilites with municipality 
- Wifi/mobile data
- Accomodation of workers near job site (ideally)
- **Start odering materials as part of planning phase**
  - Especially ones with long lead times & consumables
- Prepare safety plans; purchase all safety equipment
- Purchase relevant insurances
- Contractors are required to supply bonds to ensure successful project completion (need to read up on details here)
- Ensure all permits are obtained
- licenses, taxes
- Submit a quality management plan
- Ensure all deliverables are submitted to client: e.g. contract schedule, saftey plan, environmental plan, quality plan, insurance policies, bonds, method statements
- **Prepare a project plan** that combines tasks, milestones, staffing, materials
- Mobilisation checklist (ensure staff is available and first tasks are lined up) 
- Risk review, reviewed at least bi-monthly, contains major risks and mitigations



## Chapter 2 - Starting the Project

- Careful not to focus too much on first milestone and instead think a lot about planning that's required
- Top priority: set up office with power & internet
- Plan site for future expansion; avoid having to move office in order to bring in large equipment
- Focus on setting up site for safety (signage, tool storage, etc.)
- Issue Welcome packs with basic info to workers
- Project Induction/Briefing for each team member
- Project Manager should go over rules and responsibilities on the site for each new staff
- Consider all site setup steps:
  - Set up Site Hours, Accomodation, Transportation, Fencing and Security, Parking Areas
  - Traffic diversions and road closures if necessary
  - Stormwater drainage to protect laydown area, offices and access routes from flooding
  - Signage/postings/lighting
- **Set up Document Control System**
  - On large project, separate document control person
  - Set up correspondence registers and maintain them
  - Staff should be allocated to track documentaiton progress, to ensure it isn't a blockers
- **Preconstruction Survey and Photographs**
  - If working close to existing structures; do a pre-construction survey to capture state of them before construction begins
    - Create report from these photos and hand to clients
- **Accepting Handover of Work Areas**
  - Before starting work, ensure the work area you're receiving is in state specified in contract
  - Record handover date, state of work area + survey photos
- **Survey and setting-out**
  - Information on where to start building new structure should be provided by client
  - Ensure exact location and elevation is known before setting out new structure
  - *Nice anecdoate of using prefab wall panels for a casino, where it later turned out they didn't fit due to incorrect size information. Contractor had confused inside edge of brick wall with outside edge, resulting in room that was too small.*
- Set up communication channels between all stakeholders

## Chapter 3 - Scheduling

- Case study: new gas power station schedule
 - Schedule viewed all different structures and services in isolation and scheduled them as if they were stand-alone entities
   - Delay on one structure did not cause a delay on a dependent structure in the schedule
   - Congested areas were not taken into account
   - Should have been obvious that not all that work could happen easily in parallel yet "even the best scheduling software was not going to show this interface. You can't just depend on a computer generated bar chart to show how a structure should be constructed."
   - Rough cross-sectional drawings can be most useful technique to understand dependencies
 - *Access* can be a significant problem on many job sites and needs to be considered in the schedule
 - Wrong milestones were set in the schedule, causing bad incentives (turbines installed too early, limiting access, installation itself was disruptive and unnecessary at that point in time)
   - This seems to happen frequently in experience of the author
 - Coordination with other contractors is also often required for access to the site; interface between contractors is essential part of the schedule
 - **Schedule was too detailed**, staff didn't care about looking things up in complicated schedule, so instead just created their own.
- Schedule might be created by the PM or a dedicated planner
- Can be super simple hand-written or using specialized scheduling software
- Schedule needs to consider:
  - Staffing, material, equipment, lead time for procurement, allow for weather, specific environmental requirements (e.g. reduced work hours due to noise), clearly identify activities, detailled enough to allow progress monitoring, linked relationships, activity for completion of punch list items, clear milestone dates
  - Each activity should have duration
- Resource leveling is important to ensure a similar amount of staff is used throughout wide parts of the project
- Be aware of long-lead time items
- Critical path is most important (same as for all PM)
- Contract schedule needs to be approved as soon as possible after receiving contract documents
- S-curves and histograms are useful tools to measure progress
- Schedules are often not kept up to date
- Author likes to do weekly non-technical review of schedule, where he uses pen and paper to mark items that are behind/ahead of schedule
- Even if schedule is kept up to date, **often PMs and other team members don't understand the schedule date** (this is where it seems technology could come in...)
- Many PMs are not good at communicating relevant part of schedule to relevant ppl
- Author recommends hiding float from customers, to keep that time as buffer. Contractor should also clearly state in contract that float belongs to them
- Variations of schedule that are due to client need to be kept track off (e.g. info missing)
- Revised schedules need to be re-approved
