### Key takeaways

- A systems consists of three parts: *elements*, *interconnections*, *function (purpose)*. Almost everything is a system, except for collection of unconnected pieces without any function (sand scattered on the road by happenstance).
- Systems thinking offers an alternative to reductionist thinking; it focuses on elements, interconnections and functions, allowing answering questions that cannot be answered with reductionist thinking (a behavior of a system cannot be understood simply by understanding all of its parts, an understanding of connections is required).
- Replacing the elements in a system usually has the smallest impact on the system's behavior. Its functions and interconnections are a lot more important in defining its behavior. The exception are the few critical elements that can change the design of the system itself (e.g. executives in a company).
- A system's purpose is usually the most important ingredient. Changing the purpose without changing elements and functions can have huge impact on behavior of the system.
- Systems cause their own behavior to a large extent (not external factors). E.g. the economic system inherently causes boom and bust cycles on which politicians only have a limited impact (reductionist thinking usually leads us to believe that behavior of the economy is an effect that has its cause in political activity).
- Timely and accurate information flow within a system are critical for good decision making processes. Most system failures can be attributed to the lack of timely and accurate information.
- Certain types of problems (systemic problems) require system thinking in order to fix them. Today system thinking isn't applied to nearly enough problems.

### Extended takeaways

- Reductionist vs systems thinking:
  - Reductionist focused on bottom up thinking; looking at causes and effects, focusing on small understandable pieces (e.g. rules of physics)
  - Systems thinking operates on a higher level, understanding relationships between different stocks and flows. It allows exploring interconnections that cannot be looked at through a reductionist way of thinking (a behavior of a system cannot be understood simply by understanding all of its parts, an understanding of connections is required).
- System characteristics:
  - A systems consists of three parts: *elements*, *interconnections*, *function (purpose)*. Almost everything is a system, except for collection of unconnected pieces without any function (*sand scattered on the road by happenstance*)
  - Almost all systems have a core function of self-perpetuation
  - Systems are composed of subsystems
  - **A system's purpose is usually the most important ingredient.** Changing the purpose without changing elements and functions can have huge impact on behavior of the system.
  - Systems cause their own behavior to a large extent (not external factors). E.g. the economic system inherently causes boom and bust cycles on which politicians only have a limited impact.
  - Feedback loops (reinforcing & balancing) are critical components of many systems. Delays in feedback loops can cause oscillations in stocks, as flow changes are operating on outdated information (e.g. housing supply is increased with a delay after housing shortage occurs due to time between receiving the information and constructing new homes).
  - Systems have three key characteristics: resilience (a system bounces back into is original shape after changes up to a certain limit), self-organization (capacity of a system to change its own structure; e.g. evolution), hierarchy (composition of simple systems into a more complex one; reducing amount of information each system needs to be concerned with)
- Timely and accurate information flow within a system are critical for good decision making processes
- The two key elements for describing systems are diagrams that describe structure and time graphs that describe behavior
- The book offers various solutions to avoid common system traps: tragedy of the commons, policy resistance, drift to low performance, escalation, shifting the burden to the intervenor (e.g. modern medicine shifts responsibility for health from individual to healthcare systems), success to the successful (competitive exclusion), rule beating, seeking the wrong goal

### Key Quotes

On feedback loops:

> In physical, exponentially growing systems, there must be at least one reinforcing loop driving the growth and at least one balancing loop constraining the growth, because no physical system can grow forever in a finite environment.
>
> [Example of capital flow into oil extraction]
>
> Here is a new balancing feedback loop that ultimately will control the growth of capital: the more capital, the higher the extraction rate. The higher the extraction rate, the lower the resource stock. The lower the resource stock, the lower the yield of resource per unit of capital, so the lower the profit (with price assumed constant).

On hieararchies and composition in systems:

> When a subsystem's goals dominate at the expense of the total system's goals, the resulting behavior is called **suboptimization**.

On understanding systems:

> You can't navigate well in an interconnected, feedback-dominated world unless you take your eyes off short-term events and look for long term behavior and structure.

*Very similar to Ray Dalio's thoughts on being "above the blizzard". In general, Dalio seems to make a lot of use of systems thinking, what he calls a "machine" can be considered a system*.

> Seeing systems whole requires more than being "interdisciplinary", if that word means, as it usually does, putting together people from different disciplines and letting them talk past each other.

On flawed economic thinking (too focused on short-term changes to flows instead of also considering stocks; e.g. focus on GDP, which only measures production, instead of also considering all existing physical capital):

> But without seeing how stocks affect their related flows through feedback processes, one cannot understand the dynamics of economic systems or the reasons for their behavior. 
>
> Second, and more seriously, in trying to find statistical links that relate flows to each other, econometrcians are searching for something that does not exist. There's no reason to expect any flow to bear a stable relationship to any other flow. Flows go up and down, on and off, in all sorts of combinations, in response to stocks, not to other flows.

On drawing boundaries between systems:

> There are no separate systems. The world is a continuum. Where to draw a boundary around a system depends ont he purpose of the discussion - the question we want to ask.

On designing systems:

> At any given time, the input that is most important to a system is the one that is most limiting.

> Before you disturb a system in any way, watch how it behaves.

Really important when joining a new organization and considering to redesign it.

On system resilience:

> One of the big mistakes we make is to strip away these "emergency" response mechanisms because they aren't often used and they appear to be costly. In the short term, we see no effect from doing this. In the long term we drastically narrow the range of conditions over which the system can survive.

*Floods in Houston are a good example; where housing and streets have been built in areas that were previously intended for flood prevention - covering soil with concrete thereby reducing the amount of water that can be absorbed.*

> Missing information flows in one of the most common causes of system malfunctions.

*Example mentioned: dutch housing development where the same house was built in different ways, resulting in some of them having the electricity meter in the hallway and some in the basement. On average the houses with the meter in the hallway used 30 percent less electricity -> shows importance of steady availability of data.*

On monitoring systems:

> Pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable

### My thoughts on the book

Decent basic introduction to systems thinking and its terminology. Would have appreciated more sophisticated examples of applied systems thinking; all the ones in the book were rather simple and systems wouldn't require any particular system thinking tools to understand them.

The last part of the book, on how to change systems was the most valuable to me. It describes interesting system traps as well as leverage points for changing systems.
