### Key takeaways

- Reductionist vs systems thinking:
  - Reductionist focused on bottom up thinking; looking at causes and effects, focusing on small understandable pieces (e.g. rules of physics)
  - Systems thinking operates on a higher level, understanding relationships between different stocks and flows. It allows exploring interconnections that cannot be looked at through a reductionist way of thinking (a behavior of a system cannot be understood simply by understanding all of its parts, an understanding of connections is required).
- System characteristics:
  - A systems consists of three parts: *elements*, *interconnections*, *function (purpose)*. Almost everything is a system, except for collection of unconnected pieces without any function (*sand scattered on the road by happenstance*)
  - Almost all systems have a core function of self-perpetuation
  - Systems are composed of subsystems
  - **A system's purpose is usually the most important ingredient.** Changing the purpose without changing elements and functions can have huge impact on behavior of the system.
  - Systems cause their own behavior to a large extent (not external factors). E.g. the economic system inherently causes boom and bust cycles on which politicians only have a limited impact.
- Systems usually determine the how an organization functions, not individual members. Only members that can change the system can fundamentally change how an organization works (these are typically the members at the top of the system). Replacing a member of a system without change the system will likely not yield different results.
