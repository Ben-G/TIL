A lovely poetic book about overcoming the resistance that's in the way of realising one's dreams.

Pressfield describes life in terms of either being an amateur or a pro. An amateur being a person that gives into short-term rewards, distractions, etc. instead of identifying and pursuing their actual goals.

Turning pro is a change in mindset that focuses on the work that needs to be done in the present. A pro finds joy in the work itself, without focusing on short-term rewards.
