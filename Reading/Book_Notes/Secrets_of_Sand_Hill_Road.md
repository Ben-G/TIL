### Intro

- VC represents a relatively small portion of assets, but it has an outsized impact on the economy:

> venture-backed companies now spend 44 percent of the entire R&D budget for American public companies. The 665 public companies that are VC-backed make up a fifth of the total market capitalization of public companies. They employ four million people.

- How much is invested into VCs depends largely on asset allocation of LPs. This means if there's more money from LPs than investable opportunities, prices (aka valuations) go up.

### Chapter 1: Born in The Bubble

- 1999-2000 produced roughly 900 IPOs
- Netscape IPOd in 1995, just 18 month after founding
- In 2000 LPs commited 100bn to VCs; In 2017 it was down to 33bn
- Some other nice anecdotes:

> the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of the companies listed in the Nasdaq index stood at 175.
>
> At the time, Cisco was anticipated by many to become the first $1 trillion market capitalization company. Alas, Ciscoâ€™s market cap peaked at about $555 billion in March 2000; today it stands around $200 billion.

- LoudCloud, (Ben Horrowitz's startup of which author was first employee) raised $120m at a valuation of >$800m for a less than one year old startup
- a16z, founded in 2009 (author joined them early), was focusing on offering a differentiated approach to venture capital; providing services (like recruiting and sales support) in addition to mere capital

### Chapter 2: So Really, What is Venture Capital?

- VC is not only for tech. Other well known VC-backend companies include: Staples, Home Depot, Starbucks, and Blue Bottle Coffee.
- VC as an overall asset class is weak, "as recently as 2017, the median ten-year returns in VC were 160 basis points below those of Nasdaq". But VC returns follow a power-law curve. Best funds significantly outperform major indexes. VCs that outperform tend to benefit from signalling and subequent network effects; e.g. best startups are trying to get investment from brand investors.
