### Key takeaways

- Great companies typically have strong-willed, fearless yet humble leaders; they are the type of leaders that build organizations that can outlast them (**Level 5 leadership**). Leaders with large egos are often successful, too, but companies fail after their departure (Level 4 leadership).
- You need the right people "on the bus" and the bad fits "of the bus" first, before you can start thinking about strategy (**First Who… Then What**). You should put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems.
- Create a culture that is willing to confront brutal facts (**Confront the brutal facts (yet never loose faith)**). Do this by leading with questions, not with answers. Engage in dialog and debate, not coercion. Conduct autopsies, without blame. Build "red flag" mechanisms (ability for anyone in the organization to raise an important concern).
- Develop a single unifying concept, that anything you do should relate to (**Hedgehog concept**) to focus the organization and avoid distractions. These three components should guide you in finding the concept:
  - What you can be the best in the world at
  - What drives your economic engine
  - What are you deeply passionate about



# Quick Summary

Book compares 11 companies that made the transition from a good company (average returns on stock investement), to great companies (returns multiple times higher than average, over a given timeframe) to companies in similar industries & circumstances that didn't make that transition. The idea of the research is to identify the major differences between these two types of companies.

Below are the different ingredients the book identified, that were part of every single good-to-great company.



## Level 5 Leadership

This quality describes having a selfless leader that focuses on building an enduring culture instead of forcing behavior with a strong personality. Level 5 leaders manage to build great companies, that remain great if even after they leave.





### Key quotes

> The good-to-great companies paid scant attention to managing change, motivating people, or creating alignment. Under the right conditions, the problems of commitment, alignment, motivation and change largely melt away.

#### First Who … Then What

> I don't know where we should take this company, but I do know that if I start with the right people, ask them the right questions and engage them in vigorous debate, we will find a way to make this company great.



> The "genius with a thousand helpers" model is particularly prevalent in the unsustained comparison companies.



> The only way to deliver to the people who are achieving is to not burden them with the people who are not achieving.



> When in doubt, don't hire - keep looking.

> The moment you feel the need to tightly manage someone, you've made a hiring mistake. The best people don't need to be managed. Guided, taught, led - yes. But not tightly managed.
>
> [...]
>
> We invest time in trying to properly manage the person, we build little systems to compensate for his shortcomings, and so forth. But the situation doesn't improve. When we go home, we find our energy diverted by thinking (or talking to our spouses) about this person.

> Indeed, one of the crucial elements in taking a company from good to great is somewhat paradoxical. You need executives, on the one hand, who argue and debate - sometimes violently - in pursuit of the best answers, yet, on the other hand, who unify filly behind a decision, regardless of parochial interests.

Bezos's disagree & commit + Dalio's idea meritocracy.

> The people we interviewed from the good-to-great companies clearly loved what they did, largely because they loved who they did it with.

Dalio's focus on meaningful relationships.

### Confront the brutal facts (yet never loose faith)

> There is no worse mistake in public leadership than to hold out false hopes soon to be swept away.

Winston Churchill, *The Hinge of Fate*.

> Indeed, for those of you with a strong charismatic personality, it is worthwhile to consider the idea that charisma can be as much a liability as an asset. Your strength of personaliy can sow the seeds of problems, when people filter the brutal facts from you. You can overcome the liabilites of having charisma, but it does require conscious attention.

> Leadership does not begin just with vision. It begins with getting people to confront the brutal facts and to act on the implications.

> If you have the right people, they will be self-motived. The key is to not demotative them. One of the primary ways to demotivate people is to ignore the brutal facts of reality.

### The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles)

> Foxes pursue many ends at the same time and see the world in all its complexity. They are "scattered or diffussed, moving on many levels," says Berlin, never integrating their thinking into one overall concept or unifying vision. Hedgehogs on the other hand, simplify a complex world into a single organizing idea, a basic principle or concept that unifies and guides everything. It doesn't matter how complex the world, a hedgehog reduces all challenges and dilemmas to simple - indeed almost simplistic - hedgehog ideas. For a hedgehog, anything that does not somehow relato the the hedgehog idea holds no relevance.

> [...]
>
> You want to know what separates those who make the biggest impact from all the others who are just smart? They're hedgehogs.

> To go from good to great requires transcendeding the **curse of compotence**. It requires the discipline to say, "Just because we are good at it - just because we're making money and generating growth -  doesn't necessarily mean we can become the best at it". The good-to-great companies understood that doing what you are good at will only make you good; focusing solely on what you can potentially do better than any other organization is the only path to greatness.

> When Gilette executives made the choice to build sophisticated, relatively expensive shaving systems rather than fight a low-margin battle with disposables, they did so in large part because they just couldn't get excited about cheap disposable razors.

Similar to Dalio's "Meaningful work"

> Despite its vital importance (or, rather because of its vital importance), it would be a terrible mistake to thoughtlessly attempt to jump right to a Hedgehog Concept. You can't just go off-site for two days, pull out a bnch of flip charts, do breakout discussions, and come up with a deep understanding.

> Recognize that getting a Hedgehog concept is an inherently iterative process, not an event.
>
> The essence of the process is to get the right people engaged in vigorous dialogue and debate, infused with the brutal facts and guided by questions formed by the three circles.
>
> [...]
>
> One particularly useful mechanism for moving the process along is a device that we came to call the Council. The Council consists of a group of the right people who participate in dialogue and debate guided by the three circles, iteratively and over time, about vital issues and decision facing the organization.

> The Council does not seek consensus, recognizing that consensus decisions are ofthen at odds with intelligent decisions. The responsibility for the final decision remains with the leading executive.
>

### A Culture of Discipline

Discipline >> Bureaucracy; most companies add bureaucracy to deal with a small percentage of their team that shouldn't be "on the bus".

Being radically honest about your performance is critical, don't editorialize:

> You can change your plans through the year, but you never change what you measure yourself against. You are rigorous at the end of the year, adhering exactly to what you said was going to happen. You don’t get a chance to editorialize.
