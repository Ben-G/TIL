## Where to got after product market fit (interview with Marc Andreesen)

http://growth.eladgil.com/book/introduction/where-to-go-after-product-market-fit-an-interview-with-marc-andreessen/

> I think there are three big categories. Once there’s product/market fit, **then the main thing becomes taking the market**—which is to say, figuring out how to get the product to the entire market, how to get dominant market share; because most tech markets tend to end up with one company with most of the market share.



> In fact, the general model for successful tech companies, **contrary to myth and legend, is that they become distribution-centric rather than product-centric**. They become a distribution channel, so they can get to the world. And then they put many new products through that distribution channel.
>
> **One of the things that’s most frustrating for a startup is that it will sometimes have a better product but get beaten by a company that has a better distribution channel.** 



> The problem is, the early adopters are only ever a small percentage of the overall market. And so a lot of founders, especially technical ones, will convince themselves that the rest of the market behaves like the early adopters, which is to say that the customers will find them. And that’s just not true.



> One of the things you see crystal clearly in VC is how much competition emerges whenever anything works. Every single time we say, “Oh, this startup is unique. There’s some unique product here and there’s not going to be competition,” invariably six months later there are 20 venture-backed competitors doing the exact same thing. And so at some point, if the early  guys don’t get to the other 95% of the market, somebody else is going to go take it away. 



> Probably an under-told part of the Google story is how M&A built Google. People, I think, don’t even necessarily remember the number of things that Google bought that turned into what you think of today as Google-originated products.



> As far as defensibility, I think you construct defensibility through some combination of product innovation and distribution building. You construct it.

Interesting discussion on pricing; still think early low pricing can be valuable:

>  What I hear from companies is, “Oh, we have an awesome moat, and we’re still going to price our product cheap, because we think that’s somehow going to maximize our business.” I’m always urging founders to raise prices, raise prices, raise prices.
>
> First of all, raising prices is a great way to flesh out whether you actually do have a moat. If you do have a moat, the customers will still buy, because they have to. The definition of a moat is the ability to charge more. And so number one, it’s just a good way to flesh out that topic and really expose it to sunlight.
>
> And then number two, companies that charge more can better fund both their distribution efforts and their ongoing R&D efforts. Charging more is a key lever to be able to grow. And the companies that charge more therefore tend to grow faster.



> I think network effects are great, but in a sense they’re a little overrated. The problem with network effects is they unwind just as fast. And so they’re great while they last, but when they reverse, they reverse viciously. Go ask the MySpace guys how their network effect is going. Network effects can create a very strong position, for obvious reasons. But in another sense, it’s a very weak position to be in. Because if it cracks, you just unravel. I always worry when a company thinks the answer is just network effects. How durable are they?



> You want to have a relatively flat R&D structure. You basically want to have autonomous teams, where each team is guaranteed to have a great product person and a great architect. And that’s the model.

On building teams around strong people that can build new produts:

> This is why I always ask people, okay, let’s just do an inventory of how many of those people you think you have. And even at really, really big companies, it’s not a large number. Even at giant companies there might be ten or twenty of each, maybe. And then you build the rest of the engineering organization around those people, including all the rest of the stuff that you do for recruiting and onboarding and all that other stuff. **But at the core of it, who do you actually have who can conceptualize new products, and who do you actually have who can build it?**



> **Elad:** **If it does get distributed, do you have any perspective on whether it should be a general management, verticalized structure versus a matrixed one?**
>
> **Marc:** **I generally think matrixed is death, so I’m always pushing companies to go to a flat structure of independent teams.** I’m really on the Jeff Bezos program on that, the two-pizza team thing.[1](http://growth.eladgil.com/book/introduction/where-to-go-after-product-market-fit-an-interview-with-marc-andreessen/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-389) I think hierarchies kill innovation for the most part. And I think that matrixes are just lethal in most cases. There are exceptions, but in most cases, you need original thinking and speed of execution, and it’s really hard to get that in anything other than a small-team format, in my view.

# Chapter 3: Recruiting, Hiring and Managing Talent

> **MOVE FAST**
> Every company I have ever worked for, or with, has realized that one of the biggest determinants of candidate conversion is how quickly you interview them and how quickly you can make an offer. Beyond conversion, a key metric to track is how long candidates spend in each step of the interview process. You should optimize for shorter times between each step and for rapidly getting offers out.

> **CHECK CANDIDATES’ REFERENCES**
>
> Reference checks are often the clearest signal on a candidate. You should reference-check everyone. Be careful with businesspeople—they tend to provide friends in their organization as references, and in general will get glowing recommendations from their friends. I have found engineering and other functions to be more direct/honest when providing references for their friends. To compensate for this, try to broaden the scope of references you check for businesspeople to other functions to ensure clarity of their skills and areas for improvement.

**On diversity**

> **1. Ensure that you have diverse candidates for each role.** You will never have a diverse employee base if you do not ensure diverse candidates in your funnel. Building a diverse funnel means not only sourcing a broader spectrum of candidates, but also thinking through the language in your job descriptions, how employees are represented on your website, and other factors that will impact who applies.

Good blog on diversity: https://www.paradigmiq.com/blog/

**New roles as recruiting organization scales**

> **3. Candidate researchers.** These people may scrub LinkedIn for all the engineers at Google, prioritize them, put them into a spreadsheet, and then hand off the spreadsheet to the sourcers to actually do the outreach/pitch the candidates to interview.
>
> These people usually only really get added to the team as it scales from 100+ to 1,000+ people, and you are hiring large numbers of people in the same role.
>
> **4. Recruiting marketing.** These are the folks who develop marketing materials, run ads, organize recruiting events, hackathons, website content, etc. to create an inbound pipeline of candidates. At a startup, this is usually driven by someone on the team you are recruiting for (e.g., an engineering manager for engineering candidates). Alternatively, the marketing team at the startup may be responsible for this as part of their overall marketing efforts. Only as a company scales to a few hundred people or more does the possibility of a standalone coordinating recruiting marketing role emerge.

**On onboarding**

> **Set Goals**
> Each manager can set 30-, 60-, and 90-day goals for new employees. This gives a sense of direction, context, and structure for the new employee. It also emphasizes what is important to get done and that individual’s priorities.

**On dealing with "old timers" that might haven't scaled with the organization**

> A common sign that an old-timer will work out is their eventual acceptance that their role and influence at the company will shrink in the short- to medium-term as the team scales, but that it will expand with time as they continue to learn and the company continues to scale. 



> - **Inappropriate exertion of power.** Some early employees or founders may have a large title as a historical artifact but little influence. The person who was CTO at 10 people may still be CTO at 1,000 people, despite not having any reports or real responsibilities. This is even stronger with cofounders, who will have strong influence at a startup whether they are still active with the company or not. Some cofounders or people with fancy titles may lobby or push parts of the company to do things they want even if they are not supposed to. Often, the other employees do not realize the cofounder or titled employee is acting out of band with the rest of the executive team.
> - **Getting too rich.** Due to secondary stock sales and tender offers it is possible to partially cash out. Some employees may suddenly be liquid to the tune of tens of millions of dollars and get distracted by travel, buying houses and cars, or other issues.




# Chapter 5: Organizational Structure and Hypergrowth

## You can't delegate culture (interview with Patrick Collison)


#### On the necessity of describing the present culture as explicitly as possible, before bringing folks onboard:

> **Patrick:** [...] If you aren’t having these explicit conversations about what your culture is, the downsides are threefold: You don’t have the right people joining you, and you’re being unfair to those who do join you, in the sense that they end up being surprised by this emergent friction and tension in work styles. Thirdly, and I think this may be the non-obvious one, people’s disposition with regard to the company is actually a function of what they feel like they signed up for. If they feel like they signed up for an all-encompassing project, they’ll be much more willing to treat it that way than if they discovered it by surprise later on. And so you can actually change the outcome simply by being explicit at the outset.

> Q: **And by outset, you mean during the interview process? Or during the onboarding?**
>
> **Patrick:** Before offer acceptance. I think it can still work during onboarding, but ideally before acceptance.

#### On changing culture over time:

> **Patrick:** [...] The other failure mode, then, once you’ve succeeded in being explicit enough about your culture, is becoming overly wedded to it. And this is the tension: you need to be explicit about what you are, but also willing to revisit it.
>
> [...]
>
> Where are outcomes undesirable or insufficient because of deficiencies in the degree to which people are following the culture, and where are they deficient because of what the culture itself is? Is it the implementation or is it the spec?

#### On navigating cultural change (with a focus on long time employees that enjoyed culture of the early days)

> **Patrick:** The first-order thing is simply being clear that you do not want to preserve culture; you want to collectively steer the right evolution of the culture.
>
> [...]
>
> It’s really easy to learn the wrong lessons from early success. I really think you need to be explicit about that, that the challenge is not in preserving the culture but in having it evolve the right way. 
>
> [...]
>
> **The second thing is, when doing things that involve change to the culture—** **maybe hiring a senior external leader or creating a new function in the company—embrace and be explicit about the fact that it is going to change the culture.** So, for example, you’re hiring a new head of sales, and people are concerned that that’s going to shift the culture, rather than saying, “Well, we’ve taken all these measures to avoid that happening, and we’re going to be hyper attentive to anything that looks like a shift,” be honest. Part of the point of hiring this person is to change the culture. If this person has no effect on the culture, they’ve probably failed. You’re hiring a senior sales leader because you want the company to sell more, and you want the company to become a culture that is better at selling things.

#### On dealing with disagreements around cultural change

> **Patrick:**  Often when people raise problems with you, they’ll be real problems, legitimate ones, ones you’ll ideally fix.
>
> [...]
>
> Sometimes, though, people are going to disagree with things or raise objections or indeed be naysayers for reasons that you simply disagree with. They think the company should work X way, and maybe it used to work X way, but you have now made the decision that it ought to work Y way. In those cases, to have a healthy and effective relationship, it’s necessary to be explicit with that person that they need to decide either that Y is a thing they can be okay with and can enthusiastically sign up for or that this may not be a happy and fulfilling environment for them over the long term.
>
> This can be a painful conversation, because these people are often naysayers because they’re deeply invested in what the company is. But sometimes that becomes an investment in what the company was. Most people are quite good at staying with that evolution, which is a difficult exercise and an unnatural exercise in some ways. 
>
> [...]
>
> Again, **the mistake that I see companies make all the time is simply not being honest about those conversations.** It drags on for a year or two on both sides, and then in the end people are dissatisfied, they’re not doing well at their job, and they depart on bad terms.
>
> I would just try to front-load those conversations. Keep things non-acrimonious, and sort of non-emotional, where it’s, “Look, we’re going to do Y. Can you set aside your perhaps underlying desire for X and sign up for it? Or not? We’re not going to judge you if you don’t want to do that.”

#### On reinforcing culture
> **Patrick:**  I think the macro thing to bear in mind with a lot of culture stuff is that a rapidly scaling human organization is an unnatural thing. 
>
> [...]
>
> **I think most companies start to explicitly encode and articulate their principles or values too late.** I would try to produce a provisional revision literally when you’re just a handful of people. Then continue to update it on an ongoing basis, because assuredly there will be things you realize or come to appreciate are wrong over the course of the company.
>
> But I would start with something right from the outset. And I would absolutely weave it into your product development, your collective communications with each other, your decision-making in general.

#### On delegating culture

> **Patrick:** I think it’s generally a bad idea for a couple of reasons, if by culture czar you mean someone who is not the CEO. Firstly, the people who you’ll be tempted to appoint as that individual are typically people who have a great degree of personal, emotional investment in what the company is. And that needs to change.
>
> [...]
>
> The second reason I think it’s a bad idea is because the CEO ultimately does not have that many jobs, but I think culture is among them. And it ought not be delegated. Briefly speaking, I think there are five top responsibilities of a CEO: being the steward of and final arbiter of the senior management; being the chief strategist; being the primary external face for the company, at least in the early days; almost certainly being the chief product officer, although that can change when you’re bigger; and then taking responsibility and accountability for culture. And culture is so fundamental to what the company is that it’s truly problematic to delegate.

#### On the limits of scaling culture

> **Patrick:** I think it’s primarily a function of the experience and cohesion of your management team. So if you started out with 30 experienced managers and leaders who are all clear together on the strategy, I actually think you could scale astonishingly rapidly. Now, developing that sort of cohesion and selecting those people and hiring them and everything else—I don’t know of a company that in fact did start out with 30 of them.

#### On maintaining culture across international offices

> **Elad:** **How do you think about culture in the context of an international office or distributed team?**
>
> **Patrick:** Stripe now has on the order of 10 international offices of various sizes. And **I think the key things are to have the right site lead and initial seed crystals.** It’s not just about the lead; it’s about the two, three, four people around whom the culture of the office is going to form.
>
> [...]
>
> I think you want to have the seed crystals be people who either spend a whole bunch of time at headquarters first or, to your point, have worked at headquarters for a while and want to go live or work elsewhere. For a long time, you also want all employees at the new office to start out in headquarters for at least weeks and potentially months.
>
> [...]
>
> **Elad:** **Did they interview locally or did they interview through headquarters?**
>
> Almost everyone interviewed in headquarters. And obviously that’s going to change at some point. But the long-term value for them for just having built connections in headquarters and seen more of it is really hard to overstate.
>
> The other point—and this seems superficially minor, but I think it’s actually a big deal—is to think about the mechanics of communication. So have a really good videoconferencing setup, and rooms wired for it. Make it really easy to record a meeting, broadcast a meeting, have remote participants, and so forth.
>
> Secondly, **think about the timing of your key meetings. It often seems a bit unfortunate, I think, from a cultural perspective to move your all-hands from 5pm on Friday, when everyone’s having a beer, to Friday morning or Thursday morning or something that’s friendlier to Europe or Asia. But if you’re actually serious about these other offices, I think it’s necessary.**

#### On the importance of managing internal communication

> **Patrick:** Thirdly, once you get big enough—which I suspect is not a huge number of people, maybe 100 to 200 people—**think about internal communications as a function unto itself.** Again, I think a lot of people are resistant to it because it seems somewhat corporate. But **if you actually think that people understanding what’s going on at the company and what the top priorities are is important, it would seem a little bit strange to leave it to happenstance and to leave it as everyone’s 1% job in the back of their mind. Having somebody who’s taking overall ownership and responsibility for broad-based clarity of communication—people are generally surprised by how valuable it is once they eventually start doing it a little bit later than they should have.**

#### On learning about culture from other companies

> **Patrick:** I think people should select carefully the companies they seek to emulate and learn lessons from. It’s very easy to choose those that are contemporaries of yours or happen to be top of mind and salient. But generally speaking, if they’re contemporaries—and certainly if they’re of a remotely similar size—they’re likely to be insufficiently proven. We’re based in San Francisco, and there’s a whole host of companies here that are very prominent and easy to emulate even subconsciously but are not good examples.
>
> [...]
>
> So I spend a lot of my time talking to people and trying to read things about the greats of the earlier days of the Valley
>
> [...]
>
> For the contemporaries, here and now, the jury’s still out. My personal opinion is that some of these companies—by no means all, but some of them—are in the process of making either major cultural or organizational errors that are going to substantially impede them from becoming that which is, or was, their potential. So be careful and deliberate in choosing your role models.

#### On an emerging culture of entitlement 

> **Elad:** **As you look across the Valley now, it seems like there have been some shifts that have created almost a culture of entitlement. People get enormous benefits, then start to complain about things that may not be that important, like the number of times they can get a free haircut on campus. How do you manage that? As people get bigger and bigger benefits, how do you make sure they don’t feel that they deserve everything?**
>
> **Patrick:** I think that this is simply a challenge that we collectively have in the U.S. and in the Bay Area in this era of history. Such wealth has been created by our predecessors that we’re short-term benefiting from that it’s easy for that to have spillover effects in the culture and to distract from focus or lead to a loss of determination.
>
> [...]
>
> You have some early success or you raise series A or gain some early traction, and it’s easy, even subconsciously, to start lining up the plots in your head: “Well, Facebook raised its series A in 2005, and went on to be worth $15 billion in 2008 or 2009 or whatever it was,” and so on. And I think the effects of that, in blunt terms, are really pernicious. **In many ways it’s harder to create an organization with the kind of focused, determined, disciplined, non-complacent mindset that you need today than it was 20 or 30 years ago.** That’s just a structural headwind that we all face.
>
> There are many natural benefits and tailwinds that Silicon Valley enjoys, but I think this is one of the challenges we face. **And if Silicon Valley is supplanted by another region, or even just more broadly by a general diffusion, I think this is one of the top contenders as to why that would be the case. It’s because we had too much wealth, we had too much early success, and it caused us to lose our hunger and our edge.**
>
> People who’ve spent any time with the great software companies in China— JD, Tencent, Alibaba, and now the next generation of startups—will tell you in no uncertain terms that there is a lack of entitlement, a lack of complacency, and a real determination to succeed that is at least not uniformly present here in Silicon Valley. And so I really think it’s something that should be top of mind for everyone.
