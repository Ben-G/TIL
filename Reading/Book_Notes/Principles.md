### Key takeaways

- **For an individual, being open minded, willing to learn, be wrong and listen to others is the single most important thing.** Most people are stuck with ideas in their own head, unable to access the vast resources around them. Dalio repeatedly points out cases in which he used outside resources to find the best answer (the most impressive to me: how he triangulates doctor's opinions on a health issue and avoids a complicated operation that could have been live threatening and would have been totally unnecessary)
- An **idea meriotocracy** is usually the best model for effective decision making (better than a democracy or autocracy)
  - An idea meriotocracy means that the ideas with the most merit should be considered in a decision making process (instead of the ideas of the highest ranking or most authoratitive person in the discussion)
- To have an idea meriotocracy an organization needs to **practice radical transparency** 
  - without access to information not everyone can participate in an idea meriotocracy
  - without radical & honest evaluation one can find out how believable individual people are
- Someones merit is established by collecting data about their past ideas/decisions and their impact. People that have made successful decisions in similar circumstances in the past, should be considered most believable
- **Managers should think of their organization as a machine that is run by algorithms (principles).** Managers need to design the machine to fulfill the goals of the organization, then find people to fit into the individual roles of the machines. As much as possible the operating of the machine should be automated by defining algorithms (principles) on how decisions should be made. This catalog of algorithms should be updated over time as new information becomes available and new problems are solved (creating an issue log).



### My thoughts

Most ideas in the book are not groundbreaking. Dalio's principles go into seemingly mundane details, such as how to create good meeting notes or how to use checklists efficiently. That however is one of the great aspects of the book, it tries to cover both *"common sense"* (which Dalio correctly points out, isn't all that common) as well as higher level ideas that Dalio has come up with (organization as a machine).

It indeed seems like a comprehensive list of the learnings in his career, which is extremely valuable to use as a reference.
