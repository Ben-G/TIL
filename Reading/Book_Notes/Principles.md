Ray Dalio's talk on principles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC0Hm_9GnoU

- Mistakes -> puzzle: what can we do different in future
  - Would write down principles to allow to reuse them for future decisions
  - Embedded principles in algorithms
- Almost lost his company due to being overcertain on international debt crisis
  - -> In future tried to be less certain about his ideas; instead tried to get smart people to punch
    holes in his ideas
