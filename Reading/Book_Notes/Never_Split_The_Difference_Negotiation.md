# Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It

## Summary

The book is written by the former lead international kidnapping negotiator of the FBI - Chris Voss. It discusses various negotiation techniques that he and his team introduced during his time at the FBI that broke formerly traditional techniques. The book demonstrates how these techniques apply to the civilian world as well.

## Key Takeways

- Pure rational arguing of your points will **not** win a negotiation, instead you need to coerce your counterparts into taking your ideas as their own.
- One of the main goals during a negotiation is to learn as much as possible about the counterparts and other factors that influence the negotiation.
- The use of *calibrated questions* forces your counterpart to start problem solving and will distract them from their own demands. E.g. in hostage negotiations: "Pay $1 million dollars by tomorrow or I will hurt X". You can ask a simple question: "How am I supposed to pay that amount of money?". This way you are saying "No" without actually using the word. This will also give the counterpart a sense of control; they are the ones coming up with the answers.
- Leverage human psychology, in particular *Cognitive Biaseses*: *Framing Effect*, *Prospect Theory*, *Loss Aversion* 

## Chapter 1: The New Rules

*Old school negotiation is focused purely on logic; reality is that understanding emotions & psychology is essential for successful negotiations.*

- Old negotiation style of FBI worked on assumption of rational actors. Similar model as in popular *Getting to Yes*. Book came up with a lot of groundbreaking concepts, such as *BATNA: the Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement* (best outcome you can get if counterpart does not participate in negotiation) but ignored emotional side of negotiation.
- *Tactical Empathy:* use human desires, such as basic need to be listened to and understood to succeed in negotation.
- Negotiation serves two purpoeses: information gathering and behavior influencing



## Chapter 2: Be a Mirror

- During negotiation it's important to keep multiple hypothesis about overall situation, counterparts wants, etc. in mind. Smart people are often not good negotiatiors as they believe to understand situation too early and stop gathering information. Make as few assumptions as possible.
- "Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by the arguments that support their position that they are unable to listen [...] When they’re not talking, they’re thinking about their arguments, and when they are talking, they’re making their arguments. Often those on both sides of the table are doing the same thing, so you have what I call a state of schizophrenia: everyone just listening to the voice in their head”
- Especially early in negotiation focus on what other folks have to say instead of thinking about your own arguments. “The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually need (monetarily, emotionally, or otherwise) and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want”
- Don't go too fast in negotiations, be patient. Research shows that passage of time is one of most important negotiation tools. This is especially true if you leverage the negotiation for information gathering and trust building.
- **Tone of voice (and body language) is extremely important**; often more than the content of what we say. This has deep neurological roots. Focus more on how to say things, not on what to say. “[...] your most powerful tool in any verbal communication is your voice. You can use your voice to intentionally reach into someone’s brain and flip an emotional switch. Distrusting to trusting. Nervous to calm. In an instant, the switch will flip just like that with the right delivery.”
  - ~3 tones of voice:
    - Positive/Playful (should be used most of the time; smile while talking; signal warmth)
    - FM DJ Voice (signaling confident control; downward inflection; use e.g. when an item isn't for discussion; “You can be very direct and to the point as long as you create safety by a tone of voice that says I’m okay, you’re okay, let’s figure things out.”)
    - Assertive (should almost never be used)
- **Mirroring** can be used to leverage that people are drawn to similar people and fear different ones.
  - "Mirror" at FBI: repeat last three words someone has said (or critical one to three words).
  - Another neurological trick
  - “By repeating back what people say, you trigger this mirroring instinct and your counterpart will inevitably elaborate on what was just said and sustain the process of connecting”
  - In a study a group of waiters that mirrored back orders by repeating them, had 70% higher tips than a control group that did not mirror.
  - Mirror is better than asking for clarification: "Ask someone, “What do you mean by that?” and you’re likely to incite irritation or defensiveness. A mirror, however, will get you the clarity you want while signaling respect and concern for what the other person is saying”
- Right mindset in negotiating is a much more important than being right. Instead of being assertive in a situation of conflict, use following recipe:
  - 1.Use the late-night FM DJ voice.
  - 2.Start with “I’m sorry . . .”
  - 3.Mirror.
  - 4.Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart.
  - 5.Repeat.


## Chapter 3: Don't Feel Their Pain, Label It

- Imagine yourself in your counterpart’s situation. The beauty of empathy is that it doesn’t demand that you agree with the other person’s ideas (you may well find them crazy). But by acknowledging the other person’s situation, you immediately convey that you are listening. And once they know that you are listening, they may tell you something that you can use.
- The reasons why a counterpart will not make an agreement with you are often more powerful than why they will make a deal, so focus first on clearing the barriers to agreement. Denying barriers or negative influences gives them credence; get them into the open.
- “Pause. After you label a barrier or mirror a statement, let it sink in. Don’t worry, the other party will fill the silence.
- Label your counterpart’s fears to diffuse their power. We all want to talk about the happy stuff, but remember, the faster you interrupt action in your counterpart’s amygdala, the part of the brain that generates fear, the faster you can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust.
- List the worst things that the other party could say about you and say them before the other person can. Performing an accusation audit in advance prepares you to head off negative dynamics before they take root. And because these accusations often sound exaggerated when said aloud, speaking them will encourage the other person to claim that quite the opposite is true.
- Remember you’re dealing with a person who wants to be appreciated and understood. So use labels to reinforce and encourage positive perceptions and dynamics.
