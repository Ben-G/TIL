# About the Author

Richard H. Thaler is an economist who worked closely with psychologists Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky (and others) in shaping behavioral economics, a field that brings psychological insights to economics.



# Summary

The book details the rise of behavioral economics and the ongoing fight between behavioralists and traditionalists in economics. The book highlights many ways in which the assumptions of rational actors baked into traditional economics are provably incorrect. It also highlights how these assumptions can lead to poor economic policy.

### 1. Supposedly Irrelevant Factors

Chapter discusses how many factors traditionally considered "irrelevant" are actually very relevant to the study of Economics.

- "Compared to this fictional world of Econs, Humans do a lot of misbehaving, and that means that economic models make a lot of bad predictions."
- "Of all the social scientists, economists carry the most sway when it comes to influencing public policy. In fact, they hold a virtual monopoly on giving policy advice. Until very recently, other social scientests were rarely invited to the table..."
- "[Another way in which Economics is] the most powerful of the social sciences [is] in an intellectual sense. That power derives from the fact that economics has a unified , core theory from which nearly everything else follows . If you say the phrase “ economic theory , ” people know what you mean . No other social science has a similar foundation."
  - "The core premise of economic theory is that people choose by optimizing."
- "To simplify somewhat we can say that **Optimization + Equilibrium = Economics**"
- "Theories based on the assumption that everyone is an Econ should not be discarded . They remain useful as starting points for more realistic models ."
- "Economists get in trouble when they make a highly specific prediction that depends explicitly on everyone being economically sophisticated."
- "We don’t have to stop inventing abstract models that describe the behavior of imaginary Econs . We do , however , have to stop assuming that those models are accurate descriptions of behavior , and stop basing policy decisions on such flawed analyses . And we have to start paying attention to those supposedly irrelevant factors , what I will call SIFs for short."

### 2. Endowment Effect

- "Both Dean and his friend found the decision of whether to sell or attend the game to be an easy one. The divinity school student invited someone to go to the game with him and enjoyed himself. Dean, meanwhile, got busy scoping out which basketball-loving professors also had lucrative consulting practices. He sold his tickets for several hundred dollars each. Both Dean and his friend thought the other’s behavior was nuts. Dean did not understand how his friend could possibly think he could afford to go to the game. His friend could not understand why Dean didn’t realize the tickets were free. That is the endowment effect. I knew it was real, but I had no idea what to do with it."

### 3. The List

Thaler trying to build studies out of a long list of "dumb people things do"

- **One of my favorites from the list of odd behaviors Thaler investigated:** Stanley mows his lawn every weekend and it gives him terrible hay fever. I ask Stan why he doesn’t hire a kid to mow his lawn. Stan says he doesn’t want to pay the USD 10. I ask Stan whether he would mow his neighbor’s lawn for USD 20 and Stan says no, of course not.

- "I found the concept of hindsight bias fascinating , and incredibly important to management . One of the toughest problems a CEO faces is convincing managers that they should take on risky projects if the expected gains are high enough . Their managers worry , for good reason , that if the project works out badly , the manager who championed the project will be blamed whether or not the decision was a good one at the time . Hindsight bias greatly exacerbates this problem , because the CEO will wrongly think that whatever was the cause of the failure , it should have been anticipated in advance . And , with the benefit of hindsight , he always knew this project was a poor risk . What makes the bias particularly pernicious is that we all recognize this bias in others but not in ourselves ."

- Introduces the idea of "bounded rationality" - there are pretty strict limits to rationality of individuals and traditional Economists don't acknowledge these limits

  - > Herbert Simon, a polymath academic who spent most of his career at Carnegie Mellon University. Simon was well known in nearly every field of social science, including economics, political science, artificial intelligence, and organizational theory, but most germane to this book, he wrote about what he called “bounded rationality” well before Kahneman and Tversky came along.

### 4. Value Theory

Thaler's introduction to prospect theory.

- Prospect Theory paper by Tversky and Kahnemann

  - "The organizing principle was the existence of two different **kinds of theories: normative and descriptive**."

    - Authors believe traditional economics is only a normative model (how people should behave) and should not be used as descriptive (describing the actual behavior observed in the world) 

  - Introduces the idea of **loss aversion**

    - > Daniel Kahneman, who won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his work developing prospect theory.
      > Prospect theory is a behavioral economic theory that describes the way people choose between probabilistic alternatives that involve risk, where the probabilities of outcomes are known (=/uncertainty = do not know the possible outcomes and/or probabilities). The theory states that people make decisions based on the potential value of losses and gains rather than the final outcome, and that people evaluate these losses and gains using certain heuristics. The model is descriptive: it tries to model real-life choices, rather than optimal decisions, as normative models do.

- **Another favorite from the book!** "Here is a test to see if you are a good intuitive Pythagorean thinker. Consider two pieces of railroad track, each one mile long, laid end to end (see figure 1). The tracks are nailed down at their end points but simply meet in the middle. Now, suppose it gets hot and the railroad tracks expand, each by one inch. Since they are attached to the ground at the end points, the tracks can only expand by rising like a drawbridge. Furthermore, these pieces of track are so sturdy that they retain their straight, linear shape as they go up. (This is to make the problem easier, so stop complaining about unrealistic assumptions.) Here is your problem: Consider just one side of the track. We have a right triangle with a base of one mile, a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch. What is the altitude? In other words, by how much does the track rise above the ground?"

  - Highlights normative vs. descriptive theory

    - > we will use the Pythagorean theorem as both our normative and descriptive model and predict that people will come up with something near 30 feet . For this problem , that is a terrible prediction . **The average answer that people give is about 2 inches** (!!).

- Normative vs descriptive theory of the firm

  > William Baumol had proposed an alternative to the traditional (normative) theory of the firm (which assumes profit maximization). He postulated that firms maximize their size, measured for instance by sales revenue, subject to a constraint that profits have to meet some minimum level. I think sales maximization may be a good descriptive model of many firms.

- "The first thing I took from my early glimpse of prospect theory was **a mission statement** : Build descriptive economic models that accurately portray human behavior."

- "**People think about life in terms of changes , not levels** . They can be changes from the status quo or changes from what was expected , but whatever form they take , it is changes that make us happy or miserable . That was a big idea ."

- "The reason why people are risk - seeking for losses is the same logic that applies to why they are risk - averse for gains . In the case of problem 2 , the pain of losing the second hundred dollars is less than the pain of losing the first hundred , so subjects are ready to take the risk of losing more in order to have the chance of getting back to no loss at all . They are especially keen to eliminate a loss altogether because of the third feature captured in figure 3 : loss aversion."

- "Roughly speaking , losses hurt about twice as much as gains make you feel good ."

### 5. California Dreamin

Personal detour on how Thaler got invovled in more behavioral economics work.

- To call academic writing dull is giving it too much credit . Yet to many , dull writing is a badge of honor . To write with flair signals that you don’t take your work seriously and readers shouldn’t either . † “ Prospect Theory ” is hardly an easy read , but the writing was crystal clear because of their endless editing and Amos’s perennial goal of “ getting it right . ”

### 6. The Gauntlet

First experience of resistance from traditional economists

- "Economists do not put much stock in the answers to hypothetical questions , or survey questions in general for that matter . Economists say they care more about what people do as opposed to what they say they would do." [...] "I found the idea that you could just ask people questions and take their answers seriously to be quite liberating."

- Normative managament behavior says, RE hiring workers (using "marignal analysis"):

  - "Keep hiring workers until the cost of the last worker equals the increase in revenue that the worker produces . These results may seem innocuous enough , but in the late 1940s a debate raged in the American Economic Review about whether real managers actually behaved this way."
  - Turns out, this is not actually what managers do:
  - "Instead , they reported trying to sell as much of their product as they could , and increasing or decreasing the workforce to meet that level of demand."

- "It is in the context of this debate that Milton Friedman , a young economist headed for fame , weighed in . In an influential essay called “ The Methodology of Positive Economics , ” Friedman argued that it was silly to evaluate a theory based on the realism of its assumptions . What mattered was the accuracy of the theory’s predictions . ( He is using the word “ positive ” in his title here the way I use “ descriptive ” in this book , that is , as a contrast to normative . )"

- From Friedmans paper: "excellent predictions would be yielded by the hypothesis that the billiard player made his shots **as if** he knew the complicated mathematical formulas that would give the optimum direction of travel , could estimate by eye the angles etc . , describing the location of the balls , could make lightning calculations from the formulas , and could then make the balls travel in the direction indicated by the formulas . Our confidence in this hypothesis is not based on the belief that billiard players , even expert ones , can or do go through the process described ; it derives rather from the belief that , unless in some way or other they were capable of reaching essentially the same result , they would not in fact be expert billiard players ."

- "A good theory , it seemed , could not be defeated using just survey data , even if the defenders of the theory presented no data of their own ."

- "Fortunately , Kahneman and Tversky had provided an answer to the “ as if ” question . Both their work on heuristics and biases as well as that on prospect theory clearly showed that people did not act “ as if ” they were choosing in accordance with the rational economic model."

- "My main point was that economics is supposed to be a theory of everyone , not only experts . An expert billiard player might play as if he knows all the relevant geometry and physics , but the typical bar player usually aims at the ball closest to a pocket and shoots , often missing . If we are going to have useful theories about how typical people shop , save for retirement , search for a job , or cook dinner , those theories had better not assume that people behave as if they were experts."

- Traditional economists say incentives matter. And that surveys don't work because stakes are too low. So on experiment increased stakes:

  - > So they ran the experiments for real money , and much to their surprise , the frequency and severity of the preference reversals actually increased . **Raising the stakes made things worse .**

- "Because learning takes practice , we are more likely to get things right at small stakes than at large stakes . This means critics have to decide which argument they want to apply . If learning is crucial , then as the stakes go up , decision - making quality is likely to go down ."

- Counterpoint to the "invisible handwave" that economists argue drives rationality in markets:

  - > The vague argument is that markets somehow discipline people who are misbehaving . Handwaving is a must because there is no logical way to arrive at a conclusion that markets transform people into rational agents . Suppose you pay attention to sunk costs , and finish a rich dessert after a big dinner just because you paid for the dessert . What will happen to you ? If you make this mistake often you might be a bit chubbier , but otherwise you are fine .

  - > "Sometimes the invisible handwave is combined with the incentives argument to suggest that when the stakes are high and the choices are difficult , people will go out and hire experts to help them . The problem with this argument is that it can be hard to find a true expert who does not have a conflict of interest ."



## II Mental Accounting 1979 - 85

### 7. Bargains and Rip-Offs

- > If you understand opportunity costs and you have a ticket to a game that you could sell for USD 1,000 , it does not matter how much you paid for the ticket . The cost of going to the game is what you could do with that USD 1,000 . You should only go to the game if that is the best possible way you could use that money . Is it better than one hundred movies at USD 10 each ? [...] Still , anyone who tried to make every decision in this manner would be paralyzed . How can I possibly know which of the nearly infinite ways to use $ 1,000 will make me happiest ?

- Tverskys model for evaluating purchases

  - "Eventually I settled on a formulation that involves two kinds of utility : **acquisition utility** and **transaction utility**."
    - Acquisition utility: traditional measure of value. "suggests, it is the surplus remaining after we measure the utility of the object gained and then subtract the opportunity cost of what has to be given up."
    - Transaction utility: "It is defined as the difference between the price actually paid for the object and the price one would normally expect to pay, the reference price. Suppose you are at a sporting event and you buy a sandwich identical to the one you usually have at lunch, but it costs triple the price. The sandwich is fine but the deal stinks. It produces negative transaction utility, a **“rip-off.”** In contrast, if the price is below the reference price, then transaction utility is positive, a **“bargain,”** like Maya’s extra-large quilt selling for the same price as a smaller one."



# Other Amusing Examples of Irrationality 


- Author increased max score on his test from 100 to 137 b/c students achieving 70% of test scores felt tests were too hard. Despite still achieving 70% on new scale, students were a lot happier because the average numerical score was now 96 points.
- "An Econ would also not expect a gift on the day of the year in which she happened to get married , or be born . What possible difference can a date make ? In fact , Econs would be perplexed by the entire idea of gifts . An Econ would know that cash is the best possible gift ; it allows the recipient to buy whatever is optimal . But unless you are married to an economist , I don’t advise giving cash on your next anniversary."
- "Let a six - year - old girl with brown hair need thousands of dollars for an operation that will prolong her life until Christmas , and the post office will be swamped with nickels and dimes to save her . But let it be reported that without sales tax the hospital facilities of Massachusetts will deteriorate and cause a barely perceptible increase [...] the hospital stands in for concept Schelling calls a **“ statistical life , ” as opposed to the girl , who represents an “ identified life . ”** We occasionally run into examples of identified lives at risk in the real world , such as the thrilling rescue of trapped miners . As Schelling notes , we rarely allow any identified life to be extinguished solely for the lack of money . But of course thousands of “ unidentified ” people die every day for lack of simple things like mosquito nets , vaccines , or clean water"
- Two seemingly identical cases, two very different responses [Endowment effect / loss aversion example]

  - "**A**. Suppose by attending this lecture you have exposed yourself to a rare fatal disease. If you contract the disease you will die a quick and painless death sometime next week. The chance you will get the disease is 1 in 1,000. We have a single dose of an antidote for this disease that we will sell to the highest bidder. If you take this antidote the risk of dying from the disease goes to zero. What is the most you would be willing to pay for this antidote? (If you are short on cash we will lend you the money to pay for the antidote at a zero rate of interest with thirty years to pay it back.) 
  - **B**. Researchers at the university hospital are doing some research on that same rare disease. They need volunteers who would be willing to simply walk into a room for five minutes and expose themselves to the same 1 in 1,000 risk of getting the disease and dying a quick and painless death in the next week. No antidote will be available. What is the least amount of money you would demand to participate in this research study?"
  - "the answers to the two questions were not even close to being the same . Typical answers ran along these lines : I would not pay more than  USD 2,000 in version A but would not accept less than USD 500,000 in version B . In fact , in version B many respondents claimed that they would not participate in the study at any price ."

#### The Endowment Effect (initially found by Thaler)

> In psychology and behavioral economics, the **endowment effect** (also known as divestiture aversion and related to the mere ownership effect in social psychology) is **the hypothesis that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.

Related quote:

> Rosett said he occasionally drank one of those bottles on a special occasion , but would never dream of paying USD 100 to acquire one . He also did not sell any of his bottles to Woody . This is illogical . If he is willing to drink a bottle that he could sell for USD 100 , then drinking it has to be worth more than USD 100 . But then , why wouldn’t he also be willing to buy such a bottle ? In fact , why did he refuse to buy any bottle that cost anything close to USD 100 ? As an economist , Rosett knew such behavior was not rational , but he couldn’t help himself .

### Loss Aversion

People evaluate prospects from a specific reference point. Losses from that reference point are considered more strongly than equal sized gains.
