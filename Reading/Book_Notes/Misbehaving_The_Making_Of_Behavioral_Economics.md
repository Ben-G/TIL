# About the Author

Richard H. Thaler is an economist who worked closely with psychologists Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky (and others) in shaping behavioral economics, a field that brings psychological insights to economics.



# Summary

The book details the rise of behavioral economics and the ongoing fight between behavioralists and traditionalists in economics. The book highlights many ways in which the assumptions of rational actors baked into traditional economics are provably incorrect. It also highlights how these assumptions can lead to poor economic policy.

# Quotes

- "Compared to this fictional world of Econs, Humans do a lot of misbehaving, and that means that economic models make a lot of bad predictions."
- "Of all the social scientists, economists carry the most sway when it comes to influencing public policy. In fact, they hold a virtual monopoly on giving policy advice. Until very recently, other social scientests were rarely invited to the table..."
- "[Another way in which Economics is] the most powerful of the social sciences [is] in an intellectual sense. That power derives from the fact that economics has a unified , core theory from which nearly everything else follows . If you say the phrase “ economic theory , ” people know what you mean . No other social science has a similar foundation."
  - "The core premise of economic theory is that people choose by optimizing."
- "To simplify somewhat we can say that **Optimization + Equilibrium = Economics**"
- "Theories based on the assumption that everyone is an Econ should not be discarded . They remain useful as starting points for more realistic models ."
- "Economists get in trouble when they make a highly specific prediction that depends explicitly on everyone being economically sophisticated."
- "We don’t have to stop inventing abstract models that describe the behavior of imaginary Econs . We do , however , have to stop assuming that those models are accurate descriptions of behavior , and stop basing policy decisions on such flawed analyses . And we have to start paying attention to those supposedly irrelevant factors , what I will call SIFs for short."

# Amusing Examples of Irrationality 

- Author increased max score on his test from 100 to 137 b/c students achieving 70% of test scores felt tests were too hard. Despite still achieving 70% on new scale, students were a lot happier because the average numerical score was now 96 points.

- "An Econ would also not expect a gift on the day of the year in which she happened to get married , or be born . What possible difference can a date make ? In fact , Econs would be perplexed by the entire idea of gifts . An Econ would know that cash is the best possible gift ; it allows the recipient to buy whatever is optimal . But unless you are married to an economist , I don’t advise giving cash on your next anniversary."

- "Let a six - year - old girl with brown hair need thousands of dollars for an operation that will prolong her life until Christmas , and the post office will be swamped with nickels and dimes to save her . But let it be reported that without sales tax the hospital facilities of Massachusetts will deteriorate and cause a barely perceptible increase [...] the hospital stands in for concept Schelling calls a **“ statistical life , ” as opposed to the girl , who represents an “ identified life . ”** We occasionally run into examples of identified lives at risk in the real world , such as the thrilling rescue of trapped miners . As Schelling notes , we rarely allow any identified life to be extinguished solely for the lack of money . But of course thousands of “ unidentified ” people die every day for lack of simple things like mosquito nets , vaccines , or clean water"

- Two seemingly identical cases, two very different responses

  - "**A**. Suppose by attending this lecture you have exposed yourself to a rare fatal disease. If you contract the disease you will die a quick and painless death sometime next week. The chance you will get the disease is 1 in 1,000. We have a single dose of an antidote for this disease that we will sell to the highest bidder. If you take this antidote the risk of dying from the disease goes to zero. What is the most you would be willing to pay for this antidote? (If you are short on cash we will lend you the money to pay for the antidote at a zero rate of interest with thirty years to pay it back.) 
  - **B**. Researchers at the university hospital are doing some research on that same rare disease. They need volunteers who would be willing to simply walk into a room for five minutes and expose themselves to the same 1 in 1,000 risk of getting the disease and dying a quick and painless death in the next week. No antidote will be available. What is the least amount of money you would demand to participate in this research study?"
  - "the answers to the two questions were not even close to being the same . Typical answers ran along these lines : I would not pay more than  $2,000 in version A but would not accept less than $ 500,000 in version B . In fact , in version B many respondents claimed that they would not participate in the study at any price ."
