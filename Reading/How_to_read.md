- Key points:

  - Use symbols in your notes to classify them

  - > Finally, at the end of each chapter, flip back through it and scribble down a quick outline of what was in it. **Don’t stop a reading session at the end of a chapter without writing the summary - if you don’t do it straightaway then you never will.**

  - >  The best time to start (and ideally finish) a writeup is the same day, or at most the day after you finish a book and the knowledge is still fresh in your mind and ready for repetition. **Starting a writeup is much harder work than just moving on to the next book on your list, so it’s important to keep up momentum.**

  - > Begin your writeup with a template. I use one with headings for:
    >
    > - Reviews
    > - Summary
    > - Quotes
    > - Questions
    > - My thoughts



- Can't find the paper anymore, but some unversity also put out good ideas on how to retain more ideas from books (might have been author of "A mind for numbers")
  - Don't read book cover to cover; get idea of overview first from outline
  - Get idea of authors to understand their background and biases
  - While reading, take notes, question content where necessary; engage with the material instead of reading passively
