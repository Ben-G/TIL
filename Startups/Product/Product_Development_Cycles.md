Great post that shows how Basecamp builds features and organizes teams:

- Low level of overhead

- 6-week cycles (1-2 large features; 4-8 small features)

- Small teams (~ 3 folks)

- No time tracking

  - > No. We donâ€™t measure efficiency, compare actuals vs. estimates. We have six weeks to get something done. However a team decides to get it done during that time is up to them.
