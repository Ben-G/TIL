- A great way to capture relevant product metrics is to focus on complete journeys for individual types of users. These journeys resemble a task that a user wants to complete by using your product. They consist of multiple steps at which users can drop off. Once journeys and their steps are identified, product improvements can focus on reducing the drop off at individual steps. These metrics give good insights into how users interact with the product and which levers are available to fix the drop off rate.
