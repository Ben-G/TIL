### Learnings:

- **Sales learning curve**

  - Takes time to understand how a product needs to be sold (exactly same as it takes time for a product to be built)
  - 3 stages of learning curve:
    - Initiation
      - Basically founder sales; one stop shop
      - Can hire 2-3 sales ppl that can iterate on process
    - Transition
      - Enter this phase when there's break even (each sales rep brings in what they cost)
    - Execution (repeatable sales model)
      - 3x cost of sales is entering execution phase
      - Highly productive org has 5x
      - At this point can have sales enablement (marketing, tech sales, etc.)
    - Very different type of sales ppl for each stage

- Hire VP Sales in transition stage

- **Setting the Sales number**

  - Sales $ == investment for other parts of the org
  - Super important to have accurate number

- Bottom up forecasting

  - Pipeline, sales folks, ramp time, etc.

- Top down:

  - Growth objectives, etc.

- **Quotas**

  - Total Quota needs to be higher than company plan
    - ~20% higher
    - Some ppl might leave/underperform
  - High quota bad: sales folks will quit

- **"Coverage Matrix"**

  - Map customer segments to "routes to market"
  - Routes to market:
    - Direct sales
    - Channel sales
    - Inside sales
    - OEM
    - Freemium

- **Managing sales org**

  - Forecasting very important to balance growth & burn
  - Be transparent during forecasting
    - Very important to have sales folks to put truthful information into CRM

- **Manage revenue compensation**

  - Pay sales ppl on annual revenue (as opposed to total revenue)
  - Should only comp sales team on new & upgrade (not renewals)
  - Potentially have cusomter success (at lower revenue) be responsible for maintaining recurring revenue

- **Compensation**

  - OTE = On target earnings (per quarter)
    - E.g. 250k to make company 1 million
  - Typically base comp is half of target earnings
  - E.g. 250k OTE; means 150k base
  - Shape of compensation curve should be accelerating
  - After 100% want ppl to make "a lot of money"

- Keep compensation plans simple; not too many variables

- **Productivity**

  - 70% of sales rep should exceed quota 

- **Predicting Pipeline**

  - Pipeline data is pretty predictive
  - **Pipeline needs to be 5x the in quarter number**
  - If you want to make $1 million, you need a $5 million pipeline at the beginning of the quarter
  - Pipeline multiplier is super powerful
  - Can use that number to hold marketing and other sales enablement accountable

- Should do some math on what it takes to get to 3x/5x sales person comp in different market segments
