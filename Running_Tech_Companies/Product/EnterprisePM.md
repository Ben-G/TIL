    - Talking to existing customers is only good for incremental improvements

    - Understanding market well is a requirement, buw how?

      - > The industry press is one obvious and long-standing source of market intel, but as anyone knows, it’s… well, imperfect at best. 

      - > Industry conferences can be great — with some caveats. 

      - > Personally, I’ve found Twitter to be an invaluable source of insight on my market.

    - Competition:

      - > I hear lots of PMs focusing more on every specific product advantage or gap than on their competitor’s strategy more broadly. 

    - > Lots of teams, particularly in engineering-led company cultures, don’t strike the right balance between what they are **capable** of building (which is a lot) versus what they **should** build to capture a bigger market share — or even create a new market altogether. 

    - > In deciding what to prioritize, PMs need to know not just what the engineers can build, but what marketers can differentiate, sellers can sell, architects can implement, and customers can adopt and use.

      - Especially here I often see a lack of exchange between PM and sales

- [Interesting insights into what PMs need to work in cross-functional teams](https://www.kennorton.com/essays/leading-cross-functional-teams.html)

  - Org structure (functioal org, weak matrix/strong matrix) is never as clean as you learnt (slide 21) 
  - PMs are held accountable for success without having organizational authority; need to build political capital by speaking to all stakeholders in their language (engineers, customers, execs, sales, etc.)
