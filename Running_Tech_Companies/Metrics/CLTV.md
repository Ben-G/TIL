Simplistic formula to calculate CLT based on churn is inverse of churn:

`1/churn`

E.g.: 5% churn per month

1/0.05 = 20 month expected lifetime of a customer

Based on [`infinite geometric sequence`](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/business-of-saas).

**Problems with it:**

> one fundamental flaw in the simplicity is assuming the retention rate is fixed and identical across time
