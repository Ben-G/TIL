### [The design, implementation, and deployment of a system to transparently compress hundreds of petabytes of image files for a file storage service](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/05/08/end-to-end-optimized-image-compression/)

- Describes how Dropbox implemented and deployed a new JPEG compression algorithm and saved 46 PiB of storage to date.

### [Typed Architectures: architectural support for lightweight scripting](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/05/22/typed-architectures-architectural-support-for-lightweight-scripting/)

- Supports dynamic type checking in hardware, which significantly reduces overhead of code that needs dynamic type checking.
  - *"A recent study showed that around 25% of total execution time in the V8 JavaScript engine is spent on dynamic type checking. "*
  - *"When a tagged ALU instruction is executed, Typed Architecture looks up in a Type Rule Table with the two source type tags and the instructionâ€™s op-code as the key. If it hits, the pipeline executes normally to write back the output type tag retrieved from the Type Rule Table together with the output value to the destination register. If not, a type misprediction has happened, and the PC is redirected to the slow path pointed to by the handler register to go through the original software-based type checking."*
  - ~10% speedup in SpiderMonkey (Firefox JS Engine)

### [The new dynamics of strategy: sense-making in a complex and complicated world](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/10/17/the-new-dynamics-of-strategy-sense-making-in-a-complex-and-complicated-world/)

- Assumption that almost all outcomes can be mapped to specific behaviors, via reductionist thinking, might be wrong. We can't always determine a good strategy by looking at past outcomes. What we often assume to be causal links are often just chaotic connections

- The Cynefin framework creates 5 domains (complex, knowable, chaos, known, unkown); each require a different toolset for making sense of a situation

- >  This is the domain of complexity theory. Emergent patterns can be *perceived*, but not *predicted*, a phenomenon called ***retrospective coherence***. And this combination of perception without the ability to predict can get us into all sorts of troubles if we confuse the two

- We can end up creating procedures that worked great against historical scenarios, but might not work well in future
