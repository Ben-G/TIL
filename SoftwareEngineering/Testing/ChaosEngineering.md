  - Chaos engineering is an interesting alternative to testing / proof systems

  - Very practical way to verify behavior of increasingly complex, distributed systems

  - > To specifically address the uncertainty of distributed systems at scale, Chaos Engineering can be thought of as the facilitation of experiments to uncover systemic weaknesses.  These experiments follow four steps:
    >
    > 1. Start by defining ‘steady state’ as some measurable output of a system that indicates normal behavior.
    > 2. Hypothesize that this steady state will continue in both the control group and the experimental group.
    > 3. Introduce variables that reflect real world events like servers that crash, hard drives that malfunction, network connections that are severed, etc.
    > 4. Try to disprove the hypothesis by looking for a difference in steady state between the control group and the experimental group.
