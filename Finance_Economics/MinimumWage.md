- [Economist article on an interesting study that measures impact of Seattle's minimum wage](https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21724802-two-studies-their-impact-seattle-reach-opposite-conclusions-economists-argue)

  - Study suggests that raising minimum wage > $13 has led to measurable losses of jobs/hours in low income sector; even amounting to a net loss for low income workers

  - > hey also find that the increase in the minimum wage to $11 seems not to have had much of an effect on employment. But the second rise, to $13, led to a sharp decline in both jobs and hours worked below $13 an hour (as the new rate was phased in), which was not fully matched by increases in jobs and hours worked at or above $13. The hours lost were large enough to result in a net reduction in pay to low-wage workers averaging $125 a month in 2016.

  - NYT just published an article to counter this study: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/upshot/minimum-wage-and-job-loss-one-alarming-seattle-study-is-not-the-last-word.html?ref=business&_r=0
