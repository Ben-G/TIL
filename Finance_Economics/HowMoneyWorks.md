## How Bitcoin Forces us To Think About Money

**The talk ["How is Bitcoin Money?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQvp6AWzb9w) first made me aware of the exact details of money creation.**

**Here are the (extremely uncurated) notes I took while watching the talk:**

Where did money come from?

Real theory (Marx/others):
- non political view: money came out of the market. Money is a commodity like coins or gold 

State theory  (Friedrich)

- state: it's a legal instrument. Further perpetuated by the introduction of taxes, which brought flow of money

Credit theory (Richard Werner, Bank of England): 

- money is just the other side of debt 
- My credit in bank, is banks debt, banks owe us money 
- Bank of England: commercial banks put money in circulation (create it out of nothing)

Real estate is only thing that is part of the "real" economy. Are only collateral for private loans. 

So, is bitcoin money?

- is bitcoin a commodity?
- Maybe? There is a limit to the amount of bitcoin that can be created
- Maybe? Bitcoin is acquired through slow labor intensive work "mining", analogy to a commodity
- Bitcoin, just as $ isn't backed b anything
- $ is a credit, but there seems to be no debt behind it?
- Bitcoin is not issued by commercial banks
- Amount of debt grows faster than amount of money due to interest
- Bitcoin can create new money free of debt 

Existing money is a Ponzi scheme?

His idea of ideal money system:

- a lot of different money systems; resilience through diversity
- Today: monoculture of money
