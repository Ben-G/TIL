- [Article on Intel's progress on 10nm chips as of 2017](http://www.anandtech.com/show/11722/intel-reveals-ice-lake-core-architecture-10nm-plus)

  - Describes some of the production challenges and how these lead to 10nm adoption on smaller chips (laptops) first; since it's easier to manufacture smaller chips within a certain error tolerance.

    - > Being able to obtain high yields (ramp up) will also be a function of die size, and so the newest nodes are typically launched with smaller mobile parts in mind first, as the yields for smaller parts are better than larger parts at the same defect rate.

  - General background on 10nm process technologies

  - Moore's law in context of smaller process technologies:

    - > The first problem has been known about for a long while. Basically, starting at around the 65nm node in 2006, the economic gains from moving to smaller transistors have been slowly dribbling away. Previously, moving to a smaller node meant you could cram tons more chips onto a single silicon wafer, at a reasonably small price increase. With recent nodes like 22 or 14nm, though, there are so many additional steps required that it costs a lot more to manufacture a completed waferâ€”not to mention additional costs for things like package-on-package (PoP) and through-silicon vias (TSV) packaging.
